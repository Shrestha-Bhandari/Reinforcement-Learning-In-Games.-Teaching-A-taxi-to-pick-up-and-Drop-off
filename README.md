# Reinforcement-Learning-In-Games -Teaching-A-taxi-to-pick-up-and-Drop-off. (Q-Learning and finding Best Hyperparameter using Grid Search)
  






# Introduction

**Brief Overview**

The project looks into Reinforcement Learning (RL) within gaming landscapes, focusing on the fundamental concept of Q-Learning to teach a taxi cab to navigate intelligently in a simulated environment. RL, a subset of machine learning, enables an agent to learn by interacting with an environment, making sequential decisions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

By leveraging Q-Learning, the project aims to impart knowledge on how an AI agent can autonomously learn a strategy to navigate efficiently, exemplifying the core principles of RL. Through iterative exploration and exploitation, the agent gradually hones its decision-making abilities to maximize long-term rewards.

The implementation unfolds by simulating a taxi operating within a grid-based environment. This taxi must learn to pick up passengers from designated locations and drop them off at precise destinations while adhering to traffic rules and minimizing the total travel time.

By witnessing the taxi's learning process and observing its evolving behavior, users gain insights into the application of RL techniques, understanding how an agent learns through trial and error to achieve specific goals.

**Usage**

 **Running the Code**

1. Execution Steps:
Open the provided Google Colab notebook in your preferred browser.
 Run each cell sequentially by pressing `Shift + Enter` to execute the code segments.

2. Expected Output:
 As the code runs, you'll witness the iterative training phases of the taxi agent in the game environment.
 The output will display information on the training progress, such as episodes, steps, and agent performance metrics.

**Configuration**

1. Hyperparameters:
Users can adjust the following hyperparameters to observe varying agent performances:

n_training_episodes`: Number of training episodes.

`learning_rate`: Rate at which the agent learns from experiences.

`decay_rate`: Rate at which the exploration probability diminishes over episodes.

    - For instance, you can set the training function with specific hyperparameters:
  
 trained_Qtable = train(n_training_episodes=2000, min_epsilon=0.1, max_epsilon=1.0,     decay_rate=0.005, env=env, max_steps=100, Qtable=initialized_Qtable)


  
2. Settings:
Users can also explore changes in the number of training episodes, learning rates, and exploration rates to fine-tune the learning process.

3. Evaluation and Testing:
  The code facilitates evaluating the trained model's performance by testing the agent in various scenarios.

    - You can test the trained model's performance using the evaluation function:
    
 mean_reward, std_reward = evaluate_agent(env, max_steps=100, n_eval_episodes=100, Q=trained_Qtable)
print(f"Mean Reward: {mean_reward}, Standard Deviation: {std_reward}")
    


**Explanation of Components**

1. Q-Learning Algorithm

Overview:
   Q-Learning is a fundamental Reinforcement Learning algorithm used in this project.

    - It aims to train an agent by learning the quality of actions in a given state to maximize cumulative rewards.



Role in the Code:
    - The `train` function implements the Q-Learning algorithm.

    - It iteratively updates the Q-table based on the agent's experiences in the environment.


 2. Grid Search for Hyperparameters

**Description:**

 The code implements a grid search methodology to identify the best set of hyperparameters for optimal agent performance.

It systematically evaluates various combinations of hyperparameters to determine the most effective values.

Role in the Code:
The `grid_search_hyperparameters` function tests different combinations of hyperparameters (e.g., `n_training_episodes`, `learning_rate`, `decay_rate`) to identify the best-performing set.

  Users can explore various combinations by defining the ranges of hyperparameters


3. Evaluation Functions

Evaluation of Agent Performance:

`evaluate_agent` function evaluates the agent's performance after training.

 It calculates the mean and standard deviation of rewards obtained over a specified number of evaluation episodes.


 4. Training and Utility Functions

- `train` Function:

 Implements the main training loop for the agent.

  Updates the Q-table based on the agent's interactions with the environment.

    Other Utility Functions:
 Several utility functions handle tasks like rendering the environment, defining policies, initializing Q-tables, and recording videos (for demonstration purposes).



**Customization and Extension**

**1. Modifying Hyperparameters**

**Customization:**
    - Experiment with different hyperparameter values in the `train` function to enhance the learning process.
    - Adjust `n_training_episodes`, `learning_rate`, `decay_rate`, and `max_steps` to observe their impact on the agent's learning.

 **2. Incorporating New Environments**

    - Extend the code to operate with diverse environments provided by the OpenAI Gym.
    - Replace the existing `"Taxi-v3"` environment with other available environments to train agents for varied tasks and scenarios.

**3. Algorithmic Enhancements**

**Algorithm Modifications:**
    - Implement and test variations of the Q-Learning algorithm beyond the default configuration.

**Reward Design:**
    - Tailor the reward mechanism within the environment to suit specific learning objectives.
    - Experiment by altering the reward system to observe changes in the agent's behavior and decision-making.

**5. Integrating External Data Sources**
